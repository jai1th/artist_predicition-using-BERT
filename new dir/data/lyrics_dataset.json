use for key\nAnd you'll see\nI'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me\nBut with that said, give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nI used to think that nothing could be better than tourin' the world with my songs\nI chased the picture-perfect life, I think they painted it wrong\nI think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell\nRelationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well\nAnd ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps\nBecause you're livin' your dream, man, this shit should be fun\nPlease, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run\nI beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become\nOur conversations with my father on the A14\nAge twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams\nNow I'm playin' for the people, Dad, and they know me\nWith my beat and small guitar wearin' the same old jeans\nWembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou'\nI may have grown up, but I hope that Damien's proud\nAnd to the next generation, inspiration's allowed\nThe world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now\nSomehow\nI'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me\nBut with that said give me one more, higher\nAnother one to take the sting away\nI am happy on my own, so here I'll stay\nSave your lovin' arms for a rainy day\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nAnd I'll find comfort in my pain eraser\nI woke up this mornin' lookin' in the mirror\nThinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner\nThe industry told me to look like them\nBut I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner\nI wish that she could've been my first time\nAnd I wish that I'd never took that first line\nAnd I wish that every word in this verse rhymed\nBut forgive me if it doesn't\nI wish that I could make peace with my older cousin\nI wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't\nI wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'\nAnd the taste stays underneath my tongue and\nWish that I had known what to do as a youngen\nWish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party\nBut that hardly matters now, man, does it?\nWish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it\nI wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget\nBut while we're on the subject\nI wish my private life would have never gone public\nBut that's the sacrifice that we make\nSpendin' my whole time high livin' life away\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down here\nSittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear\nYeah, we got drama, but you know we don't care\nI wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish\nI wish my family and friends, they stay healthy\nI wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy\nI found myself late night wishin' on a star\nEveryday, I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh\nAnd I wish I'd never run through\nEvery woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to\nI wish I was the role model you looked up to\nIf I told my fans the things I did, then they'd say, \"Fuck you\"\nI wish I was home more\nI wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour\nAnd I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more people that I love 'em\nBut it's in the music that I'm known for\nAnd I wish he never got cancer\nAnd if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?\nOh, yes, I guess it does and we're still stressing 'cause\nEvery day, the **** gets the best of us\nLosin' my balance on a razor blade\nSpendin' my whole time high, wishin' life away\nI'm singin', this is how we're livin' down

cigarettes for throat coat\nMum's sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" though I don't listen, I got\nLove for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast\nPeople that I don't know share the same vision\nI find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine\nTryna find a love with a compatible star sign\nSometimes, I can't write, sentences can't rhyme\nStarin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryna find mine\nShit, quick, before I hit it again\nSurrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men\nAnd who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen\nJust let me hit the studio when we can rip it again\nI'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick\nMy daddy told me, \"Work hard and you can never be shit\"\nI've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad\nSat back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had\nOne wish",

(Oh)\nAnd the window is closin', and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows, and I'm frozen\n'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recyclin' the same old song\nBut I'd rather make Not Afraid two\nThan make another motherfuckin' We Made You, ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania\nSo when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar\nYou are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say, don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk, take it with a grain of salt\nAnd eat their fuckin' faces off\nThe legend of the angry blond lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a—\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (My dreams)\nI didn't wanna go another round (Yeah)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (Agh)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (Yeah)\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me 'round\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear",

use my motherfuckin' trailer to tease me with (Tease me with)\nBut I flipped that script like a refill of\nPainkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal (Ha)\nIt made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery\nAnd if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script (Need a script)\nAin't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick\nI still never ABC this shit\nMainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller\nSince before they called Jay Dee \"Dilla\"\nI was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit (I would be the shit)\nAnd if I ever end up escapin' these streets\nI swear that I would stay here still\nAnd if I'm crazy, I'll always be real\nDon't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler\nBreak all of my friends out of here\nAnd take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer\nPeel off back to the

kid?\nOn a track get spanked like he just did\n(Detroit) I can't never leave this bitch\nSick of bein' treated like we ain't shit\nBut Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me\nTo do features and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if\nI wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit\nSeems to be reachin' its fever pitch\nHundred and eighty degrees in here (Hah)\nShoulder blade full of cedar chips\nMCs just bit off more than they can chew\nLike a face full of Swedish Fish\nOr Lorena with two penises\nHateful and geniusness inconvenience\nAnd for the record, you don't want this type of static\nIn your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it\nMay consider tryna reinsulate your windows\nMay be in for another crazy winter\n‘Cause so cold in the D, it is\nAs days begin to tick away, but ain't this really\nWhat made me into the angry bitter blonde?\nBut ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?\nDon't make me unleash this shit, release this pit (Hah)\nMay even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit\nOr maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit\nIs playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'\nIt's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer\nSince the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter\nWith a potato peeler\nAnd mushed her face into the entertainment center (Hah)\nIt's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again\nOr the Bermuda Triangle and\nAttempted to make a safe descent\nAwaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger\nDid you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us\nTell 'em, if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want less (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\nWhat up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick\nYou either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on\nThat means Detroit vs. Everybody\nHey, Em, let me get that instrumental, take it down to the hood\nLet the little homies get this remix crackin'\nDetroit\nOkay",

scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred
